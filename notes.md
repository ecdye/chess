# Notes

My notes as I have been working through the BYU CS 240 course content.

## Random Java Reminders

### `static` keyword

The static keyword makes a method accessible without initializing the class.

## Piece Moves

It looks like the simplest way to calculate the piece moves is to use coordinates like:

```
{0,1, 0,-1, 1,0, 1,1, 1,-1, -1,0, -1,1, -1,-1}
```
